# The advantages of a scientific IDE

These are the markdown and latex sources for my SciPy 2013 talk.

To build it you need to:

1. Have `Latex`

2. Install `fabric` (`pip install fabric` should be enough)

3. Install `pandoc` from [here](http://code.google.com/p/pandoc/downloads/list)

4. On Linux, install `rubber` (`sudo apt-get install rubber` should do it on
   Ubuntu)

5. On this directory run

`fab pdf`

6. This should generate a file called `main.pdf` that contains the presentation
   in Beamer format
